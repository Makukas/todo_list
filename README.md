# TODO list

This TODO list is designed to be used by several companies or groups at once.
Employer simply creates a task for a worker from his company and then only that employee will be able to see the assigned task.

Created tasks are assigned colors depending on the remaining days until deadline.
Tasks can only be created and deleted by employers, employees can only mark the tasks as completed.
